Relay Trainer firmware

I use Cygwin as my development environment in Windows.

I use MPLAB IDE v8.87 for compiling pic/main and pic/kbddisp: you can open
the project files in these directories with MPLAB or just type 'make' to
build.

Type 'make' in the tools directory to build the simulator and assembler.
